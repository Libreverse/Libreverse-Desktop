# Build Configuration Fixes

This document explains the fixes applied to resolve the electron-builder build failure.

## Problem

The build was failing with the error:
```
/Users/runner/work/Libreverse-Desktop/Libreverse-Desktop not a file
```

This typically happens when electron-builder has path resolution issues or configuration problems.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced electron-builder Configuration

- **Separate Config File**: Created `electron-builder.json` to isolate the build configuration from `package.json`
- **Added `buildResources` Directory**: Explicitly set the build resources directory to avoid path confusion
- **Enhanced File Patterns**: Added more specific file patterns and exclusions for better control over what gets packaged
- **Added Debug Support**: Added debug scripts to help troubleshoot build issues

### 2. Before-Build Script

Created `scripts/before-build.js` that:
- Validates all required files exist before building
- Logs detailed information about the build environment
- Provides early error detection to catch issues before they cause build failures

### 3. Enhanced Build Scripts

Added new package.json scripts:
- `build:debug` - Run build with debug output
- `dist:debug` - Run distribution build with debug output  
- `clean` - Clean previous builds and cache

### 4. GitHub Actions Improvements

Updated workflows to:
- Use debug build commands for better error reporting
- Add environment validation steps
- Clean builds before starting to ensure fresh state
- Add more detailed logging

## Testing the Fixes

### Local Testing

1. **Run the verification script**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/verify-build.sh
   ```

2. **Manual build with debug**:
   ```bash
   npm run clean
   npm run dist:debug
   ```

3. **Check specific platforms**:
   ```bash
   # macOS
   npm run build:debug -- --mac
   
   # Windows (if on Windows or with Wine)
   npm run build:debug -- --win
   
   # Linux
   npm run build:debug -- --linux
   ```

### Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. **Check file permissions**:
   ```bash
   ls -la main.js preload.js renderer.js index.html
   ```

2. **Verify electron-builder version compatibility**:
   ```bash
   npm list electron-builder electron
   ```

3. **Clear all caches**:
   ```bash
   npm run clean
   rm -rf node_modules/.cache/
   rm -rf ~/.electron/
   npm ci
   ```

4. **Run with maximum debug output**:
   ```bash
   DEBUG=electron-builder:* npm run dist
   ```

## Key Configuration Changes

### Files Included
- All main application files (`main.js`, `preload.js`, etc.)
- Required assets (`icon.png`, fonts, stylesheets)
- Node modules with smart exclusions to reduce bundle size
- Explicit inclusion of `package.json`

### Directories
- `output`: `dist` (where built apps are placed)
- `buildResources`: `.` (current directory for build resources)

### Exclusions
- Test files and directories
- Documentation files in node_modules
- Unnecessary text files to reduce bundle size

## Monitoring

The GitHub Actions workflows now include:
- Build environment validation
- Debug output enabled
- Better error reporting
- Artifact verification

These changes should resolve the path-related build failures and provide better visibility into any future build issues.
